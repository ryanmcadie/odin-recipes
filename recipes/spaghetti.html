                <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>A pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
                <li>Salt and Fresh ground black pepper</li>
                <li>12 ounces dried pasta</li>
                <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.</li>
                <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly</li>
                <li>About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.</li>
            </ol>
